# project_CBA
a simple analysis of Chinese Basketball Association in the past 3 years (2016-2019)

## Because CBA has not had detail statistics for individual games, it is very difficult to quantify players' performances and estimate the value/contributions of each player.
## Thus, here we want to employ simple ways to quantify players' performances from accessible stats online and come up with a unified framework of quantifying their contributions to the game
## All the stats are from website: http://cba.sports.sina.com.cn/cba/


## Results

Typical PF/C player, whose 2pt efficiency is higher than average but also has a slightly above average 3pt efficiency. And this is the reason why he is still the best player in China.
典型大前锋/中锋球员，其2分效率远高于场均平均值，并且拥有超过一般水准的3分效率。这就是为什么他依旧是中国第一篮球员的原因。
### 郭艾伦 No.1 point guard of CBA
