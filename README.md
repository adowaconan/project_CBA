# project_CBA
a simple analysis of Chinese Basketball Association in the past 3 years (2016-2019)

## Because CBA has not had detail statistics for individual games, it is very difficult to quantify players' performances and estimate the value/contributions of each player.
## Thus, here we want to employ simple ways to quantify players' performances from accessible stats online and come up with a unified framework of quantifying their contributions to the game
## All the stats are from website: http://cba.sports.sina.com.cn/cba/


## Results
### 3pt efficiency by 2pt efficiency
### 易建联 Yi Jian Lian, 6th overall NBA draft pick 2006

Typical PF/C player, whose 2pt efficiency is higher than average but also has a slightly above average 3pt efficiency. And this is the reason why he is still the best player in China.
典型大前锋/中锋球员，其2分效率远高于场均平均值，并且拥有超过一般水准的3分效率。这就是为什么他依旧是中国第一篮球员的原因。
### 郭艾伦 No.1 point guard of CBA
![adef](https://github.com/adowaconan/project_CBA/blob/master/figures/correlation%20%E9%83%AD%E8%89%BE%E4%BC%A6.png)
Typical PG/SG two-way guard, who is young enough to be athletic. Both of his 2pt and 3pt efficiency are above average, making him the No.1 weapon of his team. However, there is a tail that connects to the low efficiency area (for both 2pt and 3pt), meaning that he has lots of low efficiency games, and this implies he is easily stoppable at some of the nights.
典型控卫/分位双能卫，其年轻力壮能让他比一般球员更富有运动能力。他的2分和3分效率都高于平均值，令他成为球队第一的武器。但是，图中有链接到低效率区的尾巴，说明他有很多低效的比赛。这说明他在一些晚上打得很挣扎。
### Jimmer Fredette, 10th overall NBA draft pick 2010

Most efficient scorer in the entire CBA with a strong 3pt efficiency at most of the night, while at some of the nights, he has both super high 2pt and 3pt efficiency. He almost does not have low efficient games.
CBA最强得分手，在大部分比赛里有着超强的3分效率，并且在一些比赛里有极强的2分和3分效率。他几乎没有低效率的比赛。
### 林志杰 No.1 shotting guard of CBA from TaiWan

Typical polarized player. At some of the nights, he is the hero, while at some other nights, he is the devil.
典型抽风球员。在一些比赛里他是英雄，但是在另一些比赛里他是魔鬼。
