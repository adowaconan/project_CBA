# project_CBA
a simple analysis of Chinese Basketball Association in the past 3 years (2016-2019)

## Because CBA has not had detail statistics for individual games, it is very difficult to quantify players' performances and estimate the value/contributions of each player.
## Thus, here we want to employ simple ways to quantify players' performances from accessible stats online and come up with a unified framework of quantifying their contributions to the game
